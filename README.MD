##  Zero2Hero-KNexus

KNexus is an innovative platform for data monetization that we built during the BNB Chain Zero2Hero Hackathon. Users can maintain control over their data and receive fair compensation for their contributions, while buyers can access high-quality data content whether on-chain data reports or AIGC prompts to enhance their own projects.
